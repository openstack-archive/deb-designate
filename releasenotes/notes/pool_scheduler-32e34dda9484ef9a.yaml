features:
  - Schedule across pools. See http://doc.openstack.org/developer/designate/pools/scheduler.html#default-provided-filters for the built in filters
upgrade:
  - The default option for the scheduler filters will be
    ``attribute, pool_id_attribute, random``.
  - To maintain exact matching behaviour (if you have multiple pools) you will
    need to set the ``scheduler_filters`` option in ``[service:central]`` to
    ``default_pool``
