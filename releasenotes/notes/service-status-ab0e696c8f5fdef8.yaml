features:
  - All designate services will now report to designate-central when they
    are running. This is implmented as a heartbeat reporting system.

    There is also a new API endpoint in the v2 API -
    $API_BASE/v2/service_status.

    This will show the list of services running, and when they last reported
    as running. Currently the "stats" and "capabilities" values will be
    blank, but will be updated in the future as services implement them.
