issues:
  - The fix for minidns's issues TCP can cause minidns to fail to send some messages.
    This manifests itself with eventlet not being able to send all the data
    before socket is closed.
critical:
  - Previous versions of eventlet changed the behaviour of socket.send() to
    match socket.sendall(). in eventlet 0.18.0 this changed and it reverted
    to the traditional behaviour. MiniDNS has been updated to allow minidns to
    push large zone transfers over long range network connections
