prelude: >
    This release has started the migration of our services to a
    ``worker`` and ``producer`` model. This has started by deprecating
    ``designate-zone-manager`` and ``designate-pool-manager``.
    We have also added support for new DNS Servers, and added scheduling
    across pools.
features:
  - Added ``designate-worker`` and ``designate-producer``. This will allow for
    better scaling across a designate system as we move forward.
upgrade:
  - To enable ``designate-worker`` and ``designate-producer`` add a section to
    your ``designate.conf`` called ``[service:worker]`` and add an option
    ``enabled = True``. Then stop ``designate-pool-manager`` and
    ``designate-zone-manager``, and start ``designate-worker`` and
    ``designate-producer``
deprecations:
  - Both ``designate-zone-manager`` and ``designate-pool-manager`` are now
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
