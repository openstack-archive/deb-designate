PowerDNS Backend
================

.. warning:: This backend will not work with PowerDNS version 4 or greater. Use the ``pdns4`` backend.



PowerDNS Configuration
----------------------

You need to configure PowerDNS to use the MySQL backend.

1. First enable the MySQL backend:

.. code-block:: ini

    launch = gmysql

2. Configure the MySQL database settings:

.. code-block:: ini

    gmysql-host=<host>
    gmysql-port=
    gmysql-dbname=<dbname>
    gmysql-user=<username>
    gmysql-password=<password>
    gmysql-dnssec=yes
    #gmysql-socket=<socket path>


.. note::
   PowerDNS can connect via socket or host/port.

3. Configure the PowerDNS Backend using this sample target snippet

.. literalinclude:: sample_yaml_snippets/powerdns.yaml
   :language: yaml

4. Then update the pools in designate

.. code-block:: console

    $ designate-manage pool update

See :ref:`designate_manage_pool` for further details on the ``designate-manage pool``
command, and :ref:`pools` for information about the yaml file syntax

4. Setup the database schema.

.. code-block:: console

    $ designate-manage powerdns sync <pool_id>

See :ref:`designate_manage_powerdns` for further details on the ``designate-manage powerdns`` command

5. Restart PowerDNS and it should be ready to serve queries using the MySQL database as the backing store.
