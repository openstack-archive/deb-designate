Agent Backend
=============

This page documents using the Pool Manager Agent backend, and it's accompanying
service, `designate-agent`. This backend uses an extension of the DNS protocol
itself to send management requests to the remote agent processes, where the
requests will be actioned.

The traffic between `designate-pool-manager`, and `designate-agent` is both
unauthenticated and unencrypted. Do not run this traffic over unsecured
networks.

Designate Configuration
-----------------------

For each designate-agent running, add a target to the pools.yaml configuration
file, using the following template:

   .. literalinclude:: sample_yaml_snippets/agent.yaml
       :language: yaml

Then update the designate pools database using the ``designate-manage pool``
command - see :ref:`designate_manage_pool` for further details on the
``designate-manage pool`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ designate-manage pool update

.. TODO: Document how to configure the agent service itself, and the available
   agent backends.
