gdnsd Agent backend
*******************


User documentation
==================

This page documents the Agent backend for `gdnsd <http://gdnsd.org/>`_.

The agent runs on the same host as the resolver. It receives DNS messages from Mini DNS using private DNS OPCODEs and classes and creates/updates/deletes zones on gdnsd using zone files under the gdnsd configuration directory.

The backend supports gdnsd from version 2.0

`gdnsd documentation <https://github.com/gdnsd/gdnsd/wiki>`_

Setting up gdnsd on Ubuntu Vivid
--------------------------------

Run as root:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update
    apt-get install gdnsd

Configuring gdnsd
-----------------

Assuming gdnsd has been freshly installed on the system, run as root:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Monitor syslog during the next steps
    tail -f /var/log/syslog

    # config check should be successful
    /usr/sbin/gdnsd checkconf

    # Start the daemon if needed
    service gdnsd status
    service gdnsd start

    # gdnsd should be listening on TCP and UDP ports
    netstat -lnptu | grep '/gdnsd'

    # Test the daemon: it should respond with "gdnsd"
    dig @127.0.0.1 CH TXT +short

Configure the "service.agent" and "backend.agent.gdnsd" sections in /etc/designate/designate.conf

Look in designate.conf.example for more complete examples

.. code-block:: ini

    [service:agent]
    backend_driver = gdnsd
    # Place here the MiniDNS ipaddr and port (not the agent itself)
    masters = 192.168.27.100:5354

    [backend:agent:gdnsd]
    #gdnsd_cmd_name = gdnsd
    #confdir_path = /etc/gdnsd
    #query_destination = 127.0.0.1

Ensure that the "zones" directory under "confdir_path" (default /etc/gdnsd) is readable and writable by the system user running the Designate Agent

Create an agent pool:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Fetch the existing pool(s) if needed
    designate-manage pool generate_file --file /tmp/pool.yaml
    # Edit the file (see below) and reload it as:
    designate-manage pool update --file /tmp/pool.yaml

The "targets" section in pool.yaml should look like:

.. code-block:: ini

  targets:
  - description: gdnsd agent
    masters:
    - host: <MiniDNS IP addr>
      port: 5354
    options: {}
    options:
    - host: <Agent IP addr>
      port: 5358
    type: agent

Start the Designate Agent. You should see log messages similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

    2016-05-03 15:13:38.193 INFO designate.backend.agent_backend.impl_gdnsd [-] gdnsd command: 'gdnsd'
    2016-05-03 15:13:38.193 INFO designate.backend.agent_backend.impl_gdnsd [-] gdnsd conf directory: '/etc/gdnsd'
    2016-05-03 15:13:38.194 INFO designate.backend.agent_backend.impl_gdnsd [-] Resolvers: ['127.0.0.1']
