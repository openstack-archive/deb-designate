Quotas
======

Overview
--------
The quotas extension can be used to retrieve a tenant's absolute limits.

*Note*: Quotas is an extension and needs to be enabled before it can be used.
If Designate returns a 404 error, ensure that the following line has been
added to the designate.conf file under "[service:api]" section ::

    enable_api_admin = True
    enabled_extensions_admin = quotas

Once these lines have been added, restart the designate-central and designate-api
services.
