Intro
=====

In the REST API examples, HTTP requests are defined as raw HTTP. For
example:

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v2/pools HTTP/1.1          # The HTTP Method, Path and HTTP Version
   Accept: application/json         # Headers
   Content-Type: application/json

   {                                # The rest is the body of request
     "pool": {
       "name": "Example Pool",
       "nameservers": [
         "ns1.example.org."
       ]
     }
   }

With this info we can make this request using the cURL_ tool. We'll
assume we are running Designate on `localhost`.

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST -i \
        -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"name": "ns1.example.org."}' \
        http://localhost:9001/v1/servers

The `-i` flag is used to dump the response headers as well as the
response body.

The cURL tool is extremely robust. Please take a look at the `cURL
tutorial`_ for more info.
