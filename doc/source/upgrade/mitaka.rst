********************************
Upgrading to Mitaka from Liberty
********************************

.. note:: This is a WIP - it will be updated as more items are added to Mitaka

Pools Configuration
===================

We have updated how the config data for pools is now stored.

Previously there was a mix of content in the ``designate.conf`` file and in the
designate database.

We have moved all of the data to the database in Mitaka, to avoid confusion, and
avoid the massive complexity that exists in the config file.

.. warning:: This part of the upgrade **requires** downtime.

We have 2 new commands in the ``designate-manage`` utility that are able to assist
the migration.

To make the config syntax simpler we have a new YAML based config file that is
used to load information into the database.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../etc/designate/pools.yaml.sample
       :language: yaml

We have a command that will allow you to take your current running config, and
export it to the new YAML format.

.. note::

    You will need to have at least one instance of central running, and machine
    ``designate-manage`` is running on will need access to the messageing queue

.. code-block:: console

    designate-manage pool generate_file --file output.yml

This will create a YAML file, with all the currently defined pools, and all of their config.

We suggest this is then migrated into a config management system, or other document management system.

From this point on all updated to pools should be one by updating this file, and
running:

.. code-block:: console

    designate-manage pool update --file /path/to/file.yml


Pools - Step by Step
--------------------

1. Ensure there is not 2 pools with the same name.
2. Stop all Designate Services.
3. Deploy new Mitaka code
4. Start ``designate-central``
5. Run
    .. code-block:: console

        designate-manage pool export_from_config --file output.yml

6. Ensure the output file is correct (reference sample file for each value)
7. Run

    .. code-block:: console

        designate-manage pool update --file output.yml --dry_run True --delete True

8. Ensure the output of this command is not removing any Pools
9. Run

   .. code-block:: console

        designate-manage pool generate_file --file output.yml --delete True

10. Start the remaining designate services.
