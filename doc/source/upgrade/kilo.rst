***************************
Upgrading to Kilo form Juno
***************************

.. note::
   This doc section is a work in progress, for now, we have some smaller
   hints and tips for watchout for during the upgrade.

Tips and Tricks
===============

1. Two new Designate services

Two new Designate services were added in Kilo, designate-pool-manager and
designate-mdns. Please ensure to configure and enable these services as
part of the upgrade.


2. Post-Migration, existing DNS domains hosted by PowerDNS must have their
"masters" column manually populated with the list of designate-mdns ip and
port pairs, and their type switched to SECONDARY. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   UPDATE powerdns.domains SET type = "SECONDARY", masters = "192.0.2.1:5354,192.0.2.2:5354" WHERE masters IS NULL;
